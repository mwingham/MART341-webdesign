Typography is the style and look of the font being used.

Having fallback fonts will ensure there is no missing characters within your text.
The font stack gives you the opportunity to control any issues that may arise as you continue
to work.

Web fonts are not installed on all operating systems while web-safe fonts can adapt
to any browser. The System font is the designated font used to be displayed on programs.
