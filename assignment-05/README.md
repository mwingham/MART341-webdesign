The website I visited on the WayBack Machine was youtube.
I visited the site from 2007, I immediately noticed a difference in the design.
The overall layout is not as good, the quality is poor in my opinion but I am not
sure if thats due to technology in that time or not. The Pictures that show the videos
are smaller than that of 2022 youtube. There are not as many tabs to go other places in
website. One thing I noticed was that 2022 Youbtube has sort of a border with options
creating a nice look for the overall layout of the website. and controls and the 2007
 youtube only has tabs at the top.
