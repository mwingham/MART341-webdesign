The universal element is used to style every element on the page. Secondly the
the element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. The class
and id selectors allow for selection based on class and ID. You may choose to use each one
differently based on the specific selections you are tryin to make.

The color palette I chose to use is one of my favorites. In order to select the right colors
I had to explore of the color wheel and move the cursor around a lot to get the exact shade
I was looking for. The neutral colors are calming and in my opinion are not too loud
for individuals looking at the page.
